This is a simple stats page which will show your current confirmed and unconfirmed coins, their balance in USD, and your current workers on MiningPoolHub.com

Simply load this anywhere on a web server with PHP. 


**There are two ways to use this page**

1.)
You have to add your API key from MiningHubPoolStats.
You can get your API Key from your account settings

2.) You can pass your API Key into the page as a variable:
_example: minerstats.php?api_key=THIS_IS_MY_API_KEY_

If this helps you in any way and you feel so inclined to donate something, I won't say no :)
